Off Center: Patio & Pub has partnered with Luke Shafer Web Design to build this website. In doing so, we are committed to creating a website that is accessible and usable for all people. Accessibility is very important to us, and we want to make sure everyone can have a positive experience on this website.

We aim to comply with web accessibility standards, including [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

If you have issues with the accessibility of this website, please reach out to a11y@lukeshafer.com. We take these matters very seriously, and someone will reach out to you as soon as possible to make your experience better.
